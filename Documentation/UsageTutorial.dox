\section tutorial0_linux On Linux

First go to the `build` folder and make sure everything is compiled by
running `cmake .. && make -j numberofcores`. If that succeeds you can
go to `build/bin` folder and run `./Pong` to run the sample pong
game. You can run tests with make like this (make sure to be in the
`build` folder): `cmake .. && make check -j numberofcores`.

\section tutorial0_windows On Windows

Start by opening `build/Leviathan.sln`. Then make sure you have
selected `RelWithDebInfo` as the active configuration (and make sure
arch is `x64`) in visual studio and then to run the Pong sample right
click the project and set as startup project then press the green
arrow in "Local Windows Debugger" or press F5. You can also run
LeviathanTest like this to verify that individual tests of the engine
run correctly.

    \section tutorial1recompiling Recompiling

    To save time you shouldn't run the setup script every time you
    have made changes. Instead on linux you should run `make -j
    numberofcores` in `project/build` folder and on Windows compile
    from visual studio.

    <b>Important</b>: when updating the scripts or assets of a game
    you must re-run cmake to make it copy the changed assets to the
    game binary folder. On Windows you should have cmd.exe (or
    powershell) open in the folder that has the solution file and run
    `cmake ..` in that when you change the assets (visual studio may
    ask you to reload the project you have open after running
    cmake. You should always reload the solution when asked). On linux
    you should combine the cmake command to make (it shouldn't do
    anything if nothing has changed) so in the build folder compile
    and run like this:
    \code{sh}
    cmake .. && make -j numberofcores && (cd bin && ./GameName)
    \endcode

/*! \page prerequisites Prerequisites
    
\section prerequisite_software Required Software

\subsection prerequisite_software_common Common

These programs are needed for all platforms:

- [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) (It is recommended to use RubyInstaller on Windows, version 2.4 or newer)

- Ruby gems (check below for details)

- git

- git lfs

- svn

- mercurial

- cmake

- boost libraries 1.66 or newer is required on windows older versions
  work on linux. (On **linux** the setup script will automatically use
  the package manager to install this. For **Windows** see \ref
  prerequisite_software_windows)

- 7zip

- Vulkan SDK (On **linux** the setup script will automatically use the
  package manager to install this)

You can check whether a program is in PATH by opening a command 
prompt/terminal and running the program by typing its name. 
For example `ruby -v` this shouldn't print an error instead you should get something like this:
\code{sh}
ruby 2.4.1p111
\endcode

\subsection prerequisite_software_windows Windows

- Visual Studio 2017 Community (make sure to enable c++ support when installing) and install
  to the default path in `C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2017/Community`
  otherwise the setup won't find it.
- Visual c++ 2010 runtime (This is required for yasm according to ffmpeg setup guide)
- Visual c++ 2015 runtime (CEF uses this, users also need this)
- [Cygwin64](https://cygwin.com/install.html). When Cygwin asks for
  which packages to install make sure the at least the following are
  selected (and to save space don't install the debug variants):
  
  - coreutils
  - make
  - bash
  - tar (with gzip support)
 
  Though cmake and git are available through cygwin, those versions
  don't work, you need the official Windows versions. Subversion and
  mercurial also have to be the Windows versions. I used SlickSVN and
  TortoiseHG. TortoiseSVN should also work if you select the option to
  add svn to PATH while installing it.
  
  After installing cygwin add `C:\cygwin64\bin` to the system
  path to make everything visible to the script

  If you have issues with not getting everything installed you can
  reference these images (that have additional packages installed, but
  also all the required ones, these screenshots are a bit outdated now):
  <a href="https://leviathanengine.com/images/setup_list_1.png">cygwin list 1</a>,
  <a href="https://leviathanengine.com/images/setup_list_2.png">cygwin list 2</a>,
  <a href="https://leviathanengine.com/images/setup_list_3.png">cygwin list 3</a>,
  <a href="https://leviathanengine.com/images/setup_list_4.png">cygwin list 4</a>,
  <a href="https://leviathanengine.com/images/setup_list_5.png">cygwin list 5</a>.

  Additionally if you have a lot of entires in your system path there
  may be conflicting names with executables from cygwin. This results
  in weird errors during ffmpeg compilation with the install
  etc. commands not accepting the parameters they are given. This can
  be fixed in two ways: either delete the conflicting programs OR make
  cygwin be the first thing in your path to let it override other
  programs if they have the same name.

- Install Git with the official installer from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

- After compiling Boost make sure to set an environment variable
  `BOOST_ROOT` to the folder where you compiled boost (for example
  `C:\projects\boost`). This is different from path, you can create
  new environment variables from the same place where you edit the
  PATH environment variable. And compile shared versions and use 64
  bit build.

  If you have multiple visual studio versions installed, you need to
  [specify the correct
  one](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_71_0/more/getting_started/windows.html#identify-your-toolset)
  (`--toolset=msvc-VERSION`). Visual studio 2017 has the version
  number 14.1

  Additional tip: when running `b2` make sure you specify the toolset,
  bitness, type and the number of cores to use for compiling like
  this:

  `.\b2 --toolset=msvc-14.1 link=shared,static address-model=64 --with-system --with-filesystem --with-program_options -j numberofcores`.
  Note: replace numberofcores with how many cores you
  have for optimal compilation time. Also if you plan on using boost
  with other projects as well remove the `--with-` options to compile
  all of the components, which takes a long time.

  If msvc isn't detected correctly, open "Developer Command Prompt for
  Visual Studio 2017" and run again in that. Just make sure to use the
  64 bit version and with that you might have to add
  `architecture=x86` as an extra parameter to b2 for it to build
  correctly. That should make boost detect visual studio.

  <a
  href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/windows.html#prepare-to-use-a-boost-library-binary">official
  boost guide</a>

- Vulkan SDK (use the [installer](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home))
  After installing you need to setup an environment variable called
  `VULKAN_SDK` pointing to the install path (for example: `C:\VulkanSDK\1.1.108.0`)

- 7zip. Download the <a
  href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">official</a> installer
  release and then once installed add the installed folder (where
  `7z.exe` is) to path. Confirm by running `7z.exe` in cmd.exe or
  powershell, it should print 7zip version info and command line
  usage.

- Install Git LFS with the Windows installer from here:
  https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases After installing
  remember to run `git lfs install`

  If you previously had Git installed through cygwin, you must
  uninstall that and install the official Windows version of Git. You
  may also have to deleted all your cloned folders to avoid errors,
  and reboot your computer to have everything detect that Git is now
  in a different place.

\subsection prerequisite_software_linux Linux

- lsb_release

- GCC 7+ or clang 5+ (clang is untested, but probably works...)

- 7zip. Use your package manager to install, it is probably named `p7zip`.

- Git lfs is likely available as a package named (git-lfs). If it is
  not install it manually. After installing remember to run `git lfs
  install`

\subsection prerequisite_software_gems Ruby Gems

- os
- colorize
- rubyzip
- json
- sha3

These can be installed by running `gem install os colorize
rubyzip json sha3`. Running with sudo is probably not required. If you get
errors installing the gems you should try updating your ruby version.

If you have trouble installing sha3 on windows: make sure you have
ruby 2.4 or newer installed with ruby installer for windows. Then run
`ridk install` and try all of the options. The third option at least
should reinstall all the ruby development tools, including gmp, which
is needed for sha3. After that your ruby native extension build tools
should be installed and the gem installation should work.

If it still doesn't work run `ridk exec pacman -S gmp-devel` and then
run `ridk install` again.

If you are a developer and want to use the Breakpad symbol uploader
you additionally need the gem `httparty`.

\subsection prerequisite_what_next Next
To compile Leviathan see \ref compiling_leviathan

\subsection prerequisite_troubleshooting Troubleshooting

\subsubsection prequisite_troubleshooting_require Require file not found

Make sure you have installed all of the ruby gems.

This is one of the potential errors (the 'os' here is the missing gem):

```
C:/Ruby24-x64/lib/ruby/2.4.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require`: cannot load such file -- os (LoadError)
```

\subsubsection prequisite_troubleshooting_boost Boost libraries not found

On Windows you need to make sure that you have compiled the needed
boost libraries on the exact same compiler version.

For Visual Studio 2017 libraries with the suffix `-vc141-mt-gd-x64`
needs to be in `boost/stage/lib` folder. Otherwise boost has not been
correctly compiled.


*/

/*! \page compiling_leviathan Compiling Leviathan

\note Before the latest setup script the prerequisites section described manual
setup for all required libraries. But now that has been replaced with
the automatic setup script. If you want to read the old version
checkout an older commit of Leviathan,
`bba062c07a952c170a16c5f9e2608896d3d09821` for example.

Make sure you have installed \ref prerequisites first.

\section compiling_clone Cloning Leviathan

If you haven't used git to clone the Leviathan repository yet. Run
this command to clone Leviathan to a new folder:
\code{sh}
git clone https://github.com/hhyyrylainen/Leviathan.git
cd Leviathan
git submodule init
\endcode

Windows tip: shift right-click in a folder and select "Open command
prompt here" or "Open powershell here" to open a cmd window to the
folder where you want to build Leviathan. If building fails you should
try a path without a space in it.

\section compiling_script Running Setup

Now move to the Leviathan folder and run the setup script:
\code{sh}
cd Leviathan
ruby Setup.rb
\endcode

If the script runs correctly you can move to the next
section. Otherwise see \ref compile_troubleshooting.


\section compile_done Done

You can run tests on linux by running `make check -j numberofcores` in
the build folder. And on Windows by running the LeviathanTest project
in visual studio debugger. Note: when you open `build/Leviathan.sln` make sure
you select `RelWithDebInfo` as the active configuration as the debug
builds are known to be broken very often.

For a tutorial on what to do next see \ref tutorial0.
Now, if the samples runs correctly, you are all set to start your own project.

\see \ref tutorials

\section compile_troubleshooting Troubleshooting

Here are some common fixes for issues you might have with the setup script.

If none of these work please open an issue here: [Leviathan
repository](https://github.com/hhyyrylainen/Leviathan/issues).

\subsection troubleshooting_submodules Submodules out of date

If you have pulled updates or changed branches your downloaded
submodules might be out of date. To fix this run:

\code{sh}
cd Leviathan
git submodule update
\endcode


\subsection troubleshooting_missing_pr Missing command `pr`

If you get an error about `pr` being an unkown command or missing try
installing Cygwin64 'coreutils' package. If that doesn't work either 
install the default set of cygwin packages.

\subsection troubleshooting_ffmpeg_line_ends  Incorrect ffmpeg makefile line endings

If you get an error "missing separator. Stop" in common.mak when
trying to build ffmpeg on windows, this is probably caused by line
endings being incorrect.

To fix these change to the FFMPEG FOLDER and run these commands to fix the line endings:
\code{sh}
git config core.autocrlf false
\endcode
Delete all files except ".git" folder. And then:
\code{sh}
git checkout .
\endcode

Warning: this will discard all changes in the git repo this is ran in,
so make sure you are in the right folder.


It is also possible to globally change the autocrlf setting but that
isn't recommended to avoid accidentally committing windows line
endings.


\subsection troubleshooting_ffmpeg Issues compiling ffmpeg

First, make sure that you are using the standard Windows command
prompt. Using a MinGW shell or equivalent is known to cause
issues. You may need to delete the ffmpeg folder after this to make
sure that there are no cached values or other things messing things
up.


Then make sure that nothing is overriding the programs in cygwin. You
should start by making sure cygwin is the first thing in PATH. And
then that the specific programs are from cygwin. This can be done by
renaming the executables in cygwin/bin, for example renaming `awk.exe`
or `make.exe` to `testawk.exe` and then verifying that the setup
script starts complaining about missing that specific program. If it
doesn't start complaining then this confirms that something is messing
with your PATH and overriding the cygwin tools.  Either delete the
offending things (MSYS, MinGW) or remove them from PATH (and make sure
once again that you are using plain `cmd.exe` to run the setup and not
some other shell).

\subsubsection troubleshoothing_ffmpeg_more ffmpeg build is still failing

For other ffmpeg building issues see these guides:
[windows guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/MSVC),
[all guides](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide)


\subsubsection troubleshoothing_no_files_found LeviathanTest or sample games don't find files

Make sure you are running them in the correct directory
(`build/bin`). On Windows check the debugging startup directory in
Visual Studio project settings.

\section compile_manually Manually Compiling

This is very much not recommended as the dependencies need to be built
with complex options and additional dependencies. Then the resulting
files need to be installed into `Leviathan/build/ThirdParty`. Then
running the main cmake configure should succeed and you can try
building. You will still need ruby for generating some C++ files so
you can't skip the ruby dependency even with trying to build manually.

For a good starting point see the note at the top of this page about older setup
instructions.

The old instructions will most likely not work anymore but provide a
good starting point for building some of the Leviathan dependencies.
